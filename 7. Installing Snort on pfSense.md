# Installing Snort on pfSense

### **Summary**

Snort is an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) owned and maintained by Cisco Systems. It is one of the most widely used tools in cybersecurity for real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks. This walkthrough provides a brief introduction to Snort and covers how to install it on pfSense in our virtual environment. Lastly, we will demonstrate its functionality by creating and testing a simple custom snort rule.

### **Snort Key Features:**

1. **Real-time Traffic Analysis:** Snort inspects incoming and outgoing packets to detect malicious activities like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, buffer overflows, port scans, and more.
2. **Packet Sniffer:** It can capture and log network packets for further analysis.
3. **Signature-Based Detection:** Snort uses a set of predefined rules (signatures) to identify known threats. The Snort Community Ruleset and subscription services provide frequent updates.
4. **Custom Rules:** Security administrators can create custom rules tailored to their environment, enabling Snort to detect unique threats.
5. **Multiple Modes:**
    - *Sniffer Mode*: Reads and displays network traffic in real-time and displays them in the console.
    - *Packet Logger Mode*: Saves captured packets to disk for future review.
    - *Network Intrusion Detection Mode*: Analyzes traffic against signature rules to generate alerts.
    
    This walkthrough will focus on the Network Intrusion Detection Mode and will be configured in pfSense..
    

### **Use Cases:**

- Network security monitoring
- Intrusion prevention (blocking malicious traffic)
- Incident response and forensics
- Compliance with security policies

### **Strengths:**

- Highly customizable and adaptable to different environments.
- Large, active community offering support, rules, and tutorials.
- Lightweight and efficient, capable of handling high-traffic networks.

### **Limitations:**

- Signature-based detection may struggle with zero-day attacks or encrypted traffic.
- Can generate false positives, requiring fine-tuning of rules.
- High-performance networks may require optimization to handle traffic volume.

Snort is commonly deployed in enterprise networks as part of a defense-in-depth strategy and can be integrated with other security tools like firewalls, SIEM systems, and log management solutions.

## Install Snort

Open pfSense dashboard and dropdown the System menu and select Package Manager.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image1.webp)

Select the “Available Packages” menu and search for “snort”. Select the “Install” button.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image2.webp)

Confirm the install.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image3.webp)

When completed you will get a “Success” message.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image4.webp)

Select the “Service” dropdown and select Snort.

## Configure Interface

We will install Snort on the ECORP interface of pfSense. This will allow access to all packets going outside and inside of the ECORP network.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image6.webp)

Select Snort Interfaces and then select the “Add” button. 

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image7.webp)

In the General Settings section, select the interface drop down and select ECORP.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image8.webp)

Keep all the defaults and then select “Save”.

## Create a Custom Snort Rule

In the Snort Interfaces menu, go to ECORP interface and select the edit icon.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image10.webp)

 

Select ECORP Rules menu. Ensure the custom.rules is selected in the Category Selection drop down.

Under Defined Custom Rules, enter the rule below.

```jsx
alert icmp HOME_NET any -> EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"Ping detected";sid:1000001)
```

 This rule alerts you whenever a ping (`ICMP`) packet is sent from your `HOME_NET` to an `EXTERNAL_NET`. It's useful for detecting outbound ping requests, which might indicate regular network diagnostics or potential reconnaissance activity.

Snort rules follows the same syntax structure. This specific rule does the following:

### **1. Action: `alert`**

- The rule is set to generate an alert if the conditions are met.
- `alert` means that when the rule matches, Snort will log the event and notify the user according to the alert settings.

---

### **2. Protocol: `icmp`**

- This rule applies to ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), commonly used by tools like `ping`.

---

### **3. Source and Destination Details**

- **Source:** `HOME_NET any`
    - `HOME_NET` is a Snort variable that typically represents your internal or trusted network.
    - `any` after `HOME_NET` means any port (ICMP doesn’t use ports, but Snort still allows the syntax).
- **Destination:** `EXTERNAL_NET any`
    - `EXTERNAL_NET` is another Snort variable, usually referring to networks outside of your environment.
    - `any` is a wildcard for any port (similarly ignored for ICMP).
- **Direction:** `>`
    - This arrow indicates the traffic flow from the source (`HOME_NET`) to the destination (`EXTERNAL_NET`).

---

### **4. Rule Options (inside parentheses)**

- **`msg:"Ping detected";`**
    - This is a human-readable message that gets logged or displayed when the rule is triggered.
    - It simply alerts that a "Ping detected" event occurred.
- **`sid:10000001;`**
    - The `sid` (Snort ID) is a unique identifier for the rule.
    - Custom rules usually have SIDs starting at 1,000,000 to avoid conflicts with built-in Snort rules.

---

## Testing the Custom Rule

### Snort as an IDS

Ensure that the Snort interface is enabled by selecting the “play” button from the Snort Interfaces menu.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image12.webp)

There will be a green arrow once the interface is enabled.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image13.webp)

Open a command prompt and ping Google’s DNS service.

```jsx
ping 8.8.8.8
```

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image14.webp)

Once the ping completes navigate to the Alerts tab. You will see that an alert was triggered for each ping packet. As seen below, the alert includes the date/time, protocol, source IP, destination IP, SID, and the description.

### Snort as an IPS

In the previous section we demonstrated how Snort can be used as an IDS, which alerts when a rule is triggered. In this section we will demonstrate how Snort can be used as an IPS, which will block the ICMP traffic.

In the Snort Interfaces menu, edit the ECORP interfaced by selecting the edit (pencil) button.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image16.webp)

In the Block Settings section select the Block Offenders box and ensure the Kill States blow is checked as well.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image17.webp)

Scroll down to the bottom and select save.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image18.webp)

You should receive a message confirming that the interface was restarted with the new configuration.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image19.webp)

Run the ping command again. As seen below, after the first packet the ping command times out. That is because those packets were blocked. 

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image20.webp)

We can confirm they were blocked by selecting the “Blocked” tab. As seen below, the ping commands were blocked and logged. The log includes the IP address, the rule message, and the date/time.

![image.png](Files/6-InstallingSnort/image21.webp)

We can also look at the Alerts tab and see that the 4 packets were also logged as an alert.

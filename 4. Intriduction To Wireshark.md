# Wireshark Part 1: Intoduction to Wireshark

Wireshark is a free, open-source, graphical network protocol analyzer and is one of the most widely used tools of its kind. Like TCPdump, Wireshark supports live and offline traffic analysis. It can capture live network traffic from any available network interface or analyze previously saved packet captures. However, as a GUI-based tool, Wireshark provides several advantages over TCPdump, including detailed protocol inspection, powerful display filters to isolate specific traffic, and the ability to follow conversations like TCP or HTTP data streams. Additionally, Wireshark offers high-level statistics, making the initial analysis process more efficient.

When comparing Wireshark and TCPdump, neither tool is strictly better—they each have unique strengths. TCPdump, a command-line tool, is highly efficient for environments with high-speed traffic and large volumes of data. It is lightweight, available on nearly all Unix-based systems, and can operate without a graphical interface, making it ideal for remote or headless systems. Wireshark, on the other hand, excels at detailed packet inspection, offering intuitive filtering, visualization, and statistical tools. However, Wireshark can struggle with very large PCAP files and may require filtering the data using tools like TCPdump or TShark before analysis.

### **Installing Wireshark**

Unlike TCPdump, Wireshark does not typically come pre-installed on Linux distributions or Windows systems. Here’s how to install it:

1. **On Linux (e.g., Ubuntu):**
    - Use the package manager to install Wireshark:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt install wireshark
        
        ```
        
    - During installation, you’ll be prompted to decide if non-root users should have permission to capture packets. By default, this is disabled, meaning you’ll need to run Wireshark with elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo`) to capture traffic.
    - 
2. **On Windows:**
    - Download the installer from [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/).
    - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
    - Include optional components, such as TShark (the command-line version of Wireshark) and Npcap (required for packet capturing).

Once installed, you can launch Wireshark and begin analyzing network traffic. On Linux systems, ensure you use `sudo` if non-root users cannot capture packets.

### **Getting Started with Wireshark**

When you open Wireshark, you’ll see a welcome screen listing:

1. Recently opened PCAP files.
2. Available network interfaces for live capture.

At the top, the toolbar provides access to common actions such as starting/stopping a capture, restarting it, or opening files. Below, the interface list shows available network interfaces, including activity indicators (e.g., graphs of live traffic). You can select a single interface or multiple interfaces for capturing traffic.

For demonstration purposes, I’ll open one of the previous pcap files.

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image2.webp)

Wireshark's main window is organized into several familiar components found in many graphical user interface (GUI) programs:

1. **Menu**: Provides access to actions and features of the program (see *The Menu in the Appendix for more details*).
2. **Main Toolbar**: Offers quick access to commonly used functions from the menu (see *The “Main” Toolbar in the Appendix for more details*).
3. **Filter Toolbar**: Allows users to apply display filters, controlling which packets are visible (see *Filtering Packets While Viewing in the Appendix for more details*).
4. **Packet List Pane**: Displays a summary of all captured packets. Selecting a packet here updates the content displayed in the other panes (see *The “Packet List” Pane in the Appendix for more details*).
5. **Packet Details Pane**: Shows a detailed breakdown of the selected packet, organized by protocol layers (see *The “Packet Details” Pane in the Appendix for more details*).
6. **Packet Bytes Pane**: Displays the raw data of the selected packet, highlighting the specific field chosen in the details pane (see *The “Packet Bytes” Pane in the Appendix for more details*).
7. **Status Bar**: Displays detailed information about the current program state and the captured data (see *The Statusbar in the Appendix for more details*).

This structure provides a logical and intuitive workflow for packet analysis.

## Capture Packets

Once you’ve installed Wireshark, you can start grabbing network traffic. But remember: To capture any packets, you need to have proper permissions on your computer to put Wireshark into promiscuous mode.

- In a Windows system, this usually means you have administrator access.
- In a Linux system, it usually means that you have root access.

As long as you have the right permissions, you have several options to actually start the capture. Perhaps the best is to select Capture >> Options from the main window. This will bring up the Capture Interfaces window, as shown below.

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image3.webp)

This window will list all available interfaces. In this case, Wireshark provides several to choose from.

For this example, we’ll select the eth0 interface, which is the most active interface. Wireshark visualizes the traffic by showing a moving line, which represents the packets on the network.

Once the network interface is selected, you simply click the Start button to begin your capture. As the capture begins, it’s possible to view the packets that appear on the screen, as shown below.

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image4.webp)

Once you have captured all the packets that you want, simply click the red, square button at the top. Now you have a static packet capture to investigate.

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image5.webp)

## **How to Filter and Inspect Packets in Wireshark**

You can apply Wireshark filters in two ways:

1. In the Display Filter window, at the top of the screen

1. By highlighting a packet (or a portion of a packet) and right-clicking on the packet

Wireshark filters use key phrases, such as the following:

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image6.webp)

You can also use the following values:

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image7.webp)

Valid filter rules are always colored green. If you make a mistake on a filter rule, the box will turn red.

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image8.webp)

Let’s start with a couple of basic rules. For example, let’s say you want to see packets that have only the IP address of 10.7.27.101 somewhere inside. You would create the following command line, and put it into the Filter window.

```jsx
ip.addr==10.7.27.101
```

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image9.webp)

Alternatively, you can highlight the IP address of a packet and then create a filter for it. Once you select the IP address, right-click, and then select the Apply As Filter option. You’ll then see a menu of additional options. One of those is called Selected. If you choose Selected, then Wireshark will create a filter that shows only packets with that IP address in it

![image.png](Files/3-IntroToWireshark/image10.webp)

You can also decide to filter out a specific IP address using the following filter, shown below.

```jsx
!ip.addr==208.111.176.64
```

| **Osmux** |  | OSmux is a multiplex protocol designed to reduce bandwidth usage of satellite-based GSM systems’s voice (RTP-AMR) and signaling traffic. The OSmux menu opens the packet counter window with the related statistic data. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file. |
| **RTP** |  | The RTP streams window shows all RTP streams in capture file. Streams can be selected there and on selected streams other tools can be initiated. |
| **RTSP** |  | In the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) menu the user can check the Packet Counter window. It shows Total RTCP Packets and divided into RTSP Response Packets, RTSP Request Packets and Other RTSP packets. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file. |
| **SCTP** |  |  |
| **SMPP Operations** |  | Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) protocol uses TCP protocol as its transfer for exchanging Short Message Service (SMS) Messages, mainly between Short Message Service Centers (SMSC). The dissector determines whether the captured packet is SMPP or not by using the heuristics in the fixed header. The SMPP Operations window displays the related statistical data. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file. |
| **UCP Messages** |  | The Universal Computer Protocol (UCP) plays role in transferring Short Messages between a Short Message Service Centre (SMSC) and an application, which is using transport protocol, such as TCP or X.25. The UCP Messages window displays the related statistical data. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file. |
| **H.225** |  | H.225 telecommunication protocol which is responsible for messages in call signaling and media stream packetization for packet-based multimedia communication systems. The H.225 window shows the counted messages by types and reasons. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file. |
| **SIP Flows** |  | Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Flows window shows the list of all captured SIP transactions, such as client registrations, messages, calls and so on. |
| **SIP Statistics** |  | SIP Statistics window shows captured SIP transactions. It is divided into SIP Responses and SIP Requests. In this window the user can filter, copy or save the statistics into a file. |
| **WAP-WSP Packet Counter** |  | The WAP-WSP Packet Counter menu displays the number of packets for each Status Code and PDU Type in Wireless Session Protocol traffic. The user can filter, copy or save the data into a file |

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Firewall ACL Rules** |  | This allows you to create command-line ACL rules for many different firewall products, including Cisco IOS, Linux Netfilter (iptables), OpenBSD pf and Windows Firewall (via netsh). Rules for MAC addresses, IPv4 addresses, TCP and UDP ports, and IPv4+port combinations are supported.
 **
It is assumed that the rules will be applied to an outside interface.

| **Credentials** |  | This allows you to extract credentials from the current capture file. Some of the dissectors (ftp, http, imap, pop, smtp) have been instrumented to provide the module with usernames and passwords and more will be instrumented in the future. The window dialog provides you the packet number where the credentials have been found, the protocol that provided them, the username and protocol specific information. |
| **MAC Address Blocks** |  | This allows viewing the IEEE MAC address registry data that Wireshark uses to resolve MAC address blocks to vendor names. The table can be searched by address prefix or vendor name. |
| **TLS Keylog Launcher** |  | This can launch an application such as a web browser or a terminal window with the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable set to the same value as the TLS secret log file. Note that you will probably have to quit your existing web browser session in order to have it run under a fresh environment. |
| **Lua Console** |  | This option allows you to work with the Lua interpreter optionally built into Wireshark, to inspect Lua internals and evaluate code. See “Lua Support in Wireshark” in the Wireshark Developer’s Guide. |

**Help**

This menu contains items to help the user, e.g., access to some basic help, manual pages of the various command line tools, online access to some of the webpages, and the usual about dialog. See

# 🌐 Network Traffic Analysis

Welcome to the **Network-Traffic-Analysis** repository — a structured and practical guide for understanding and analyzing network communications. This series is designed for students, analysts, and professionals who want to build hands-on skills in monitoring, filtering, and inspecting network traffic using tools like **Wireshark**, **TCPdump**, and **Snort** (on pfSense).

All lessons are provided in Markdown format and intended for learning in controlled lab environments.
